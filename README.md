# Hi, I’m Mrudun.

I build software, watch it break in interesting ways,  
and try to understand why.

Most things here are experiments, some turn into projects,  
and a few survive longer than expected.

---

## What you’ll notice
- Projects over polish  
- Progress over perfection  
- Decisions documented, not hidden  
- Fewer repos, more intent

If something looks unfinished, it probably is — on purpose.

---

## Current direction
Working on problems that show up in hackathons and demos  
but quietly fail in real usage.

The goal isn’t to “solve everything”,  
just to understand one part deeply and build it properly.
